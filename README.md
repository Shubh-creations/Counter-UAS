CUAS – Counter-Unmanned Aerial System (AI-Native)

CUAS is a fully AI-native, autonomous counter-UAS framework designed to detect, classify, track, and neutralize rogue drones using advanced computer vision and deep learning algorithms. Built for real-time aerial security, CUAS integrates multi-sensor intelligence, threat modeling, and automated response logic to operate in defense-critical and no-fly zones.
